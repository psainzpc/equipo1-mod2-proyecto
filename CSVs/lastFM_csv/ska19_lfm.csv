Link 80,"Link 80 was a punk rock/ska punk band from the San Francisco Bay Area.

Link 80 started in early 1994 in the famous East Bay of California. In the beginning, original members (guitarist Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, drummer Joey Bustos, bassist Adam Pereria and singer Jeff Acree) played around town as Drano, The Rag-Tags, and Mr. Slave-Unit, before settling on Link 80.

The name came from the interstate highway I-80 which they used to get to the drummer's garage for band practice and connected the band members' homes. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Link+80"">Read more on Last.fm</a>",52130,517471,Assorted Jelly Beans
